Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Flack - Javascript and Flask Single Page Web Application for sending and receiving messages

Users will be able to sign into site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time. 

Personal touch: Hide one or more unnecessary messages
